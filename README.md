## About SGCX

SGCX is a statistical AI research organization that tackles long-standing problems in statistical methodology through transparent human-AI collaboration. Our name reflects our collaborative approach:

- **S** - Hai-Shuo **S**hu (Human researcher and visionary)
- **G** - Chat**G**PT (AI collaborator) 
- **C** - **C**laude (AI collaborator)
- **X** - E**X**cellerator (The breakthrough element)

### Research Areas

- **Missing Data Analysis**: Distinguishing between MAR and MNAR mechanisms using neural networks
- **Optimizer Performance**: Revealing true optimizer performance against known global minima
- **Computational Statistics**: GPU-native statistical libraries and modern implementations
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Developing frameworks for transparent AI-assisted research

## Current Projects

### üî¨ Project Lacuna
**Neural Networks for Missing Data Mechanism Detection**
- Transformer-based architecture for missingness pattern recognition
- Addresses critical gap in pharmaceutical, financial, and insurance research
- Status: Active development, early access available

### üî¶ Project Blacklight  
**Revealing True Optimizer Performance**
- Systematic evaluation of ML optimizers against known global minima
- Statistical rigor with 20-50 runs per optimizer configuration
- Status: Research phase

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Django 5.2
- **Deployment**: Heroku (ertihan app)
