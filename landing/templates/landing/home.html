                <p><strong>Neural Networks for Missing Data Mechanism Detection</strong></p>
                <p>Project Lacuna addresses a critical gap in statistical practice: the ability to distinguish between Missing at Random (MAR) and Missing Not at Random (MNAR) mechanisms. Using transformer-based architectures with attention mechanisms, Lacuna provides quantified assessments of missingness patterns, replacing decades of statistical handwaving with evidence-based methodology.</p>
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Revolutionary tool for pharmaceutical research, biostatistics, financial modeling, and any field dealing with missing data analysis.</p>

            </div>

            <p>We believe that the most significant advances in statistical methodology will come from honest partnerships between human domain expertise and AI computational capabilities. Rather than hiding AI assistance, we celebrate it as a legitimate and powerful approach to research.</p>

            <p>Our focus areas include missing data analysis, computational statistics, and developing tools that address long-standing problems in statistical practice. We're committed to open research, reproducible methodologies, and creating practical solutions that researchers can immediately implement.</p>
