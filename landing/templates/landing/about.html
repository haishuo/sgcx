        <div class="about-content">
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>SGCX represents a new paradigm in statistical research, built on transparent human-AI collaboration. We tackle fundamental problems in statistics that have been overlooked or handwaved by traditional approaches, using modern computational methods to create practical solutions.</p>

            <h2>Our Name</h2>
            <p>Our name reflects our collaborative approach:</p>
            <div class="collaboration-highlight">
                <p><strong>S</strong> - Hai-Shuo <strong>S</strong>hu (Human researcher and visionary)<br>
                <strong>G</strong> - Chat<strong>G</strong>PT (AI collaborator)<br>
                <strong>C</strong> - <strong>C</strong>laude (AI collaborator)<br>
                <strong>X</strong> - E<strong>X</strong>cellerator (The breakthrough element)</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Research Philosophy</h2>
            <p>We believe that the most significant advances in statistical methodology will come from honest partnerships between human domain expertise and AI computational capabilities. Rather than hiding AI assistance, we celebrate it as a legitimate and powerful approach to research.</p>

            <p>Our approach combines:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 30px; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Open about AI assistance in research</li>
                <li><strong>Rigor</strong>: Maintaining statistical standards while embracing innovation</li>
                <li><strong>Practicality</strong>: Building tools researchers can use immediately</li>
                <li><strong>Impact</strong>: Focusing on problems that matter to real research</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Focus Areas</h2>
            <p>Our research spans several critical areas in statistical practice:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 30px; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Missing Data Analysis</strong>: Developing principled methods to distinguish between different missingness mechanisms</li>
                <li><strong>Computational Statistics</strong>: Leveraging modern hardware for statistical computation</li>
                <li><strong>Method Development</strong>: Creating new statistical tools for contemporary data challenges</li>
                <li><strong>Reproducible Research</strong>: Ensuring our methods can be validated and extended</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <p>Our tools and methodologies are designed for immediate implementation across:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 30px; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Pharmaceutical Research</strong>: Clinical trial analysis and regulatory submissions</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Modeling</strong>: Risk assessment and economic analysis</li>
                <li><strong>Insurance Analytics</strong>: Actuarial modeling and claims analysis</li>
                <li><strong>Academic Research</strong>: Supporting researchers across disciplines</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Commitment to Open Research</h2>
            <p>We're committed to advancing the field through open methodologies, reproducible research, and practical solutions that the entire research community can benefit from. Our work is designed to complement and enhance traditional statistical practice, not replace it.</p>
